        <p>Whales are remarkable marine mammals that capture the imagination of people around the world. These majestic creatures are the largest animals on Earth, with some species reaching lengths of up to 100 feet or more. They are known for their impressive size, graceful movements, and deep-diving abilities. Whales come in two primary categories: toothed whales, such as killer whales and sperm whales, which use their sharp teeth to catch prey, and baleen whales, like humpback whales and blue whales, which filter small organisms, like krill, from the water using baleen plates in their mouths.</p>

        <p>Swordfish, scientifically known as Xiphias gladius, are large, predatory fish renowned for their unique appearance and impressive speed. These oceanic creatures can be found in warm and temperate waters around the world, making them a popular target for sport and commercial fishing. Swordfish are instantly recognizable by their long, sword-like bills, which can extend up to one-third of their body length and give them their name. These bills, or "swords," are used both as a formidable weapon for slashing at prey and as a tool for capturing schools of smaller fish. Swordfish are powerful swimmers, capable of reaching speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) and diving to great depths in search of their preferred prey, which includes squid, various fish species, and other marine organisms. Their flesh is highly prized for its firm texture and mild flavor, making swordfish a popular choice in seafood cuisine. </p>
